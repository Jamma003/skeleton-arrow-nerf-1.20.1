Skeleton Arrow Nerf is a simple Fabric mod that reduces the speed of skeleton arrows. 

If you are playing with sprinting disabled, modern vanilla skeletons shoot arrows that are too fast to avoid, even at long distance. With this mod, sidestepping at medium range is almost always enough to avoid their arrows.

As a side effect of slowing down the arrow projectiles, they do slightly less damage.
